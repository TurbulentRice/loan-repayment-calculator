/*
Main info display container, housing
1) LoanIndex - list of Loan objects currently held in App.js
2) LoanView - chart, info, and controller of Loan branch projections

Receives from props:
1) Array of Loan objects from App state
2) removeLoan() bound method for filtering out a loan (by reference)
    from App state.loans

Keeps track of in state:
1) Index of currently selected Loan object in props.
    This is to avoid referencing props in state.
    Use getter this.currentlySelectedLoan to reference selected Loan directly.
2) Toggle for PriorityQueueView vs LoanView
